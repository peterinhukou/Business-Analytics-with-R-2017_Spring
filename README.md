# Business-Analytics-with-R-2017_Spring
This class was taught by Dr. Walter Johnston who is one of the most experienced R programmers and professional analysts
at Business Analytics program of UT Dallas. 

In this repository, I put 3 projects finished by my own effort. The 3 PDFs are assignments given by professor along with dataset of "movie_data.csv" for Homework01, "02_movie_data_subset.Rimage" for Homework02, and "Boston.csv" for Homework03. The 3 txt files are my solutions in R. The 2 JPG files are the output of my R code for Homework03.
