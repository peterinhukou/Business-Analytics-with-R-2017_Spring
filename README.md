# Business-Analytics-with-R-2017_Spring
Here are my 3 homework with R code. 
This class was taught by Dr. Walter Johnston who is one of the most experienced R programmers and professional analysts
at Business Analytics program of UT Dallas. In this repository, I put 3 homeworks finished by my own effort. 

The 3 PDFs are assignments given by professor along with dataset of "movie_data.csv" for HW01, "02_movie.Rimage" for HW02, "Boston.csv" for HW03.
